# Welcome to CCPD3V-T3@M #

Our operations team needs to create a basic project for the management of its users.

### Requirements? ###

* Page Log in.
* Page CRUD for users (basic maintenance).
* Only Admin must be able to edit user's password. 

### Service (backend)  ###

* [mockup API](ask for it)

### Complete? ###

* Create a new branch with the following name: [FrontEnd-Version-YourName]
* Commit
* Push to your branch
* You can re-write .readme in your branch and explain how to set up your project.
* Enjoy :)
